//TODO:add a wait queue for processes that don't fit into memory
//TODO: if two adjacent of memory are free, they are merged into one whole
//TODO: refactor repeated code into a function
//TODO: Compact and Release function

// 1. Request for a contiguous block of memory
// 2. Release of a contiguous block of memory
// 3. Compact unused holes of memory into one single block
// 4. Report the regions of free and allocated memory

/**
 * 
 * First fit. Allocate the first hole that is big enough. 
 * Searching can start either at the beginning of the set 
 * of holes or at the location where the previous first-fit 
 * search ended. We can stop searching as soon as we find a free hole that is large enough.
 * 
 * Best fit. Allocate the smallest hole that is big enough. 
 * We must search the entire list, unless the list is ordered by size. 
 * This strategy produces the smallest leftover hole.
 * 
 * Worst fit. Allocate the largest hole. 
 * Again, we must search the entire list, unless it is sorted by size. 
 * This strategy produces the largest leftover hole, which may be more useful
 * than the smaller leftover hole from a best-fit approach. 
 * 
 * 
 * Code play by play:
 * 
 * The head node keeps track on the total avaliable space in memory,and is a dummy node
 * The block_of_space servers as the block of inital free space
 * The temp node help us traverse through the linkedlist
 * 
 * If a new process has space to fit inside a fragmented space and there are address spaces left over
 * after inserting, a new node is created taking up the left over address spaces 
 * and initalized as unused space
 * 
 * If two free spaces are adjacent to each other they are merged together into one node / block of space
 *
